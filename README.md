# Implementation-of-ML-Model-for-Image-Classification
This repo contains the code to perform a simple image classification task using Python and Machine Learning. We will apply global feature descriptors such as Color Histograms, Haralick Textures and Hu Moments to extract features from FLOWER17 dataset and use machine learning models to learn and predict.
